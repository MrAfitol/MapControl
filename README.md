# MapControl
Map Control is a Plugin that allows you to use a lot of elements of the map itself. 

## Gatelockdown System
* Gate A and B can randomly be locked for a random amount of time
* Broadcasts and CASSIE announcements go with the locks/unlocks
* The gatelockdown command can also be used to force a GateLockdown

## TeslaDisable System
* All Tesla gates can be randomly disabled with a random ammount of time
* Broadcast and CASSIE announcements
* The classes which are able to bypass are configurable
* You can set a custom CASSIE Announcement for the first time NTF bypass a disabled Tesla gate (like in Containment Breach)

## Control the Map
* Enable/Disable all Tesla gates (via Config)
* Use the toggleteslagates (or ttg) command to enable/disable them yourself
* Set and add custom Server Broadcasts
